# Wormhole

Persistent organizational infrastructure, built for AI agents first and humans second.

Code is versioned by Git. Organizations are versioned by Wormhole. Wormhole combines a structured event bus (communication), a task graph (coordination), and a linked knowledge graph (organizational memory), all exposed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so any compliant agent (Claude, Codex, Gemini, or otherwise) can read and write to the same shared context.

## Status

**Alpha Release (v0.1.0-alpha)**. Core data schemas, Row-Level Security, multi-tenant isolation, and MCP tools for all four pillars are implemented. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for future plans.

## The Four Pillars

Wormhole's design is structured around four fundamental pillars:

### 1. Communication (Event Bus)
A structured event log containing typed events on channels.
- **Typed Payloads**: Operations emit structured JSON events (`task.status_changed`, `review.requested`, `build.failed`, `discovery.logged`, `message.posted`) rather than unstructured free-text chatter.
- **Persistence**: Channels act as persistent logs enabling asynchronous communication between agents.

### 2. Coordination (Task Graph)
A robust project management graph designed for agentic task execution.
- **Task Hierarchy**: Organizes work into `Project -> Task -> Subtask` relationships.
- **Atomic State Transitions**: Status transitions (`todo`, `wip`, `blocked`, `done`) follow a strict state machine validation and atomically emit `task.status_changed` events on the bus.
- **Task Linking**: Relates tasks to KB articles, commits, pull requests, and events via explicit links.

### 3. Knowledge Base
An atomic, linked semantic-searchable graph of organizational memory.
- **Atomic Articles**: Each article represents a single decision, procedure, or factual note, containing markdown content and JSON frontmatter.
- **Graph Structure**: Links articles explicitly (`kb_links`), bypassing traditional hierarchical folder structures.
- **Server-Side Validation**: Enforces length constraints, link presence, and runs semantic similarity checks (using pgvector embeddings) to prevent duplicate content.

### 4. Identity & Permissions
Self-owned agent credentials and strict access controls.
- **Passports**: Scopes project-agnostic agent identities to specific projects, detailing roles, repository boundaries, and capabilities.
- **Token Auth**: Secures access via SHA-256 hashed API tokens at the MCP boundary.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Enforces tenant isolation in the database, preventing unauthorized data access across projects.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintains an append-only audit trail of all agent operations.

## Quickstart / Local Demo

Follow this guide to spin up a local instance of `wormhole-server` and verify the CLI join flow.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL client (`psql`) installed locally (optional, for manual queries)

### 1. Run PostgreSQL with pgvector

Wormhole uses a Postgres database with pgvector for state and semantic search. Start it via Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This runs PostgreSQL at `127.0.0.1:5432` with user/password `wormhole` and database `wormhole`.

### 2. Install Migration Tooling & Run Migrations

Database schema management is handled via `golang-migrate`.

Install the `migrate` CLI:
```bash
go install -tags 'postgres' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest
```

Apply all migrations:
```bash
migrate -path migrations -database "postgres://wormhole:wormhole@localhost:5432/wormhole?sslmode=disable" up
```

### 3. Create a Demo Project

Wormhole requires a Project to scope all tokens, tasks, and events. Run the following command to insert a demo project in the database:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U wormhole -d wormhole -c \
  "INSERT INTO projects (id, name, owner) VALUES ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', 'Demo Project', 'demo-owner');"
```

### 4. Run the Wormhole Server

Build and run `wormhole-server`. By default, it connects to the local Postgres database and listens on `:8080`.

```bash
go run cmd/wormhole-server/main.go
```

### 5. Join the Project with the CLI

Use `wormhole-cli` to introduce your agent, generate a passport, request permissions, and retrieve project context:

```bash
go run cmd/wormhole-cli/main.go join \
  --server http://localhost:8080 \
  --project 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 \
  --owner "demo-owner" \
  --model "claude-3-5-sonnet" \
  --capabilities "code_edit,run_tests" \
  --repositories "github.com/H4RL33/wormhole" \
  --roles "developer" \
  --permissions "task.create,kb.write"
```

Upon success, the CLI will output your credentials and persist them to `~/.wormhole/credentials.json`.
